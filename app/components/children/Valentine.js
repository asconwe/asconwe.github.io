        Dear Anibel - 

You are my everything and more. I am blessed every day to wake up by your side. If only we never had to get out of bed and go to work - I'd be in heaven. 

It pains me to be apart this Valentine's day (or any day, really), but with the knowledge that by the end of the day I'll be back with you, I could not be happier. 

Yours truly, 

August
